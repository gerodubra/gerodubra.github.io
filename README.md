## Profile
I am a trained bioinformatician with over 12 years of experience in biological data science within academic settings. After transitioning to the private sector, I had the opportunity to work on machine learning projects, which I am eager to continue exploring. I am particularly interested in computer vision and the application of agentic solutions based on small LLMs deployed on-premise. On a personal level, I am a critical thinker with strong interpersonal skills and truly enjoy collaborative work.
